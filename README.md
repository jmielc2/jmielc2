### Hello and Welcome!

This is the place where I host relevant personal projects I'm eager to show off.
- Currently working on a set of personal C programming tools and utilities as well as a dynamic VR horror game
- Currently learning Computer Graphics and Computer Vision technologies
- Currently developing a browser based labyrinth puzzle game (inspired by the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur)
